Hi there! I'm Joshua, a passionate data analyst with a keen eye for uncovering insights and driving data-informed decisions. I thrive on turning raw data into actionable intelligence and love the challenge of solving complex problems through analytics.

I specialize in:

Data wrangling and cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover trends, patterns, and outliers.
Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to extract meaningful insights.
Data visualization to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.
Machine learning techniques for predictive modeling and pattern recognition.

With a strong background in Statistics, I bring 5 years of experience in the data analysis field. My previous roles have equipped me with the skills to navigate diverse datasets and derive valuable insights across industries ranging from health to finance.

Here are some highlights of my recent projects:

Automatidata Project: I help Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered.
Salifort Motors Project: The senior leadership team tasked me with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. The logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83%, on the test set. And one of the conclusion that was derived from the analysis is to Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.

What Drives Me
I'm driven by the opportunity to leverage data to make informed decisions that positively impact businesses and society. Whether it's optimizing processes, identifying growth opportunities, or addressing societal challenges, I believe in the power of data to drive meaningful change.
